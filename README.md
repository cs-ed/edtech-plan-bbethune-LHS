# Educational Technology Plan

This Educational Technology Plan is geared toward creating an effective learning environment for AP Computer Science A students at Leigh HS in San Jose, CA.

## Context

### Course

AP Computer Science A is an accelerated introduction to Java programming which is offered to interested sophomores, juniors, and seniors.

### Situation

I have been teaching math at Leigh HS in San Jose for the last twenty years.  Leigh has roughly 1800 students.  Most of these students belong to 
upper middle class, tech-savvy families, and Leigh has, within the last two years, issued every student a Chrome Book.  Our school has a high-speed 
wireless network, and the administration, faculty, students, and parents are all connected online through email, newsletters, and the Canvas platform 
that the school has adopted as a course management system.

This educational technology plan will be for AP Computer Science A classes.  Leigh actually already has a computer science program, helmed by a 
friend and colleague in the math department (and, unlike me, he is a legitimate CS guru).  There are roughly one hundred students in Leigh’s CS 
program – around fifty students who take AP CSA and the corresponding AP Exam each year in May, and around fifty students who take CSP.  Leigh uses 
“Project Lead the Way” (PLTW) curriculum in the Computer Science Principles classes.

My process for developing this plan involved initially pretending that my school did not have a running CS program.  I watched the CSED 510 lecture 
videos and ran plenty of web searches in order to make educated guesses about what hardware, software, apps, and websites might be useful when teaching 
a CSA class.  I then bounced ideas off of my friend / the “Leigh HS CS guru” in order find out which of my decisions were impractical and which of them 
were reasonable.

Though I have thoroughly enjoyed my limited exposure to coding, I don’t anticipate putting this plan into action within the next five years.  Leigh HS 
already has an extremely knowledgeable CS teacher, and I am poised to become a new parent in February (!!), so it would be a bad idea to take on a brand 
new prep / subject anytime in the near future.  Eventually I’d like to help out my colleague with the CS classes, though, particularly if the program grows 
to the point where more than one CS teacher is needed.  Currently, my colleague works with two sections of CSP students and two sections of AP CSA students.  
Each of the classes has roughly twenty-five students, and it would be nice to maintain that class size even as the program grows.

My goals with this plan for teaching AP CSA at Leigh HS are to:

•	Set up an AP CSA classroom in which students have a clear understanding of the work flow (what an “average day” in class looks like… what resources/ 
        websites we will make extensive use of,…)
        
•	Set up a classroom in which teacher works to have a strong understanding of the “big” ideas and the key vocabulary involved with CS (and in which 
        students can rely on teacher to explain these things clearly)
        
•	Set up a classroom in which students are empowered to “build” their own understanding of coding through a balance of collaborative vs. solo 
        assignments and a blend of small-scale “problems” and larger scale “labs” and “projects”


Projected timeline for implementation:  2027 / 2028.  My daughter-to-be will be 5 or 6 years old, and, hopefully, I will feel at least reasonably 
confident in my “parenting skills” at that point (?).


## Plan

### Software Specifications

Describe the software that you will use. Include software used for students as
well as any software the instructor will use. This should include any software
installed as well as any online services.

### Hardware Specifications

Describe the hardware requirements for your class. Provide specific requirements
wherever necessary.

### Application

Describe how you will use the above technologies in the class, including
in-class activities, homework, assignments, and assessment. Justify the use
in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, evidence-based and inclusive pedagogy.

### Impacts

How will the technology help *all* students learn? In this section, you can also
describe how you address class resiliency, such as adapting to
transitions to virtual education, social/legal/ethical challenges,  and/or
evolving course contexts.
